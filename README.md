<h4> Using Git to Clone the Repository </h4>
  <h5><i> Checking your installation </i></h5>
  <p>
  Once you have downloaded and installed Git, you should be able to access it from your computer's default command line application. 
  <ul>
    <li> If you are using <b> Windows </b>, you can access this application by going to the Start menu in the bottom left corner, and       typing "cmd" into the Search bar. Once you have opened a command prompt, try typing <code> git --version </code> into it. If the         command prompt returns a version number, you have successfully installed Git! Otherwise, check out this <a                               href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=albr1o7Z1nw"> video </a> to troubleshoot your installation. </li> 
    <li> If you are using a version of <b> Apple's iOS </b>, you can access your default command line application by searching               "terminal" in your Finder search bar. Once you have an open command prompt, try typing <code> git --version </code> into it. If your     terminal returns a version number, you have successfully installed Git! Otherwise, check out this                                       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LK0vMt_lEbQ"> video </a> to troubleshoot your installation. </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  
  <h5><i> Cloning the repository </i></h5>
  <p>
  Now that we have verified that you can successfully access Git from the command line, we can now use Git to make a copy of the           repository somewhere on your drive. In order to do this, you are going to have to choose what location to download the repository to.
  <ul>
    <li><b> Windows: </b> You can see what directory you are currently in by checking the path to the left of your cursor on the             prompt. In the picture below, we can see that the current directory is the user folder "richB", under the "Users" folder, under the     "C:" drive.

    If, say, richB wanted to go to the Documents folder of his D: drive instead, he might use commands like these:
      <ol>
        <li><code> D: </code> : By typing <code> D: </code> into the command prompt, richB can change his current directory from                 his C: drive to another drive on his computer, in this case, D:. </li>
        <li><code> dir </code> : By typing <code> dir </code> into the command prompt, richB can see the contents of the directory               he's currently in. </li>
        <li><code> cd <path> </code> : By typing <code> cd </code> followed by some path to a directory on the drive, richB can change           his current directory to his desired one. Keeping with our example, he'd type something like                                             <code> cd D:\Files\Documents </code></li>
      </ol>
    
    </li>
    
    <li><b> Mac: </b> You can see what directory you are currently in by checking the path to the left of your cursor on the prompt</li>
  </ul>
