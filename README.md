  Once you have downloaded and installed Git, you should be able to access it from your computer's default command line application.

    <li> If you are using <b> Windows </b>, you can access this application by going to the Start menu in the bottom left corner, and         typing "cmd" into the Search bar. Once you have opened a command prompt, try typing <code> git --version </code> into it. If the           command prompt returns a version number, you have successfully installed Git! Otherwise, check out this <a                                 href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=albr1o7Z1nw"> video </a> to troubleshoot your installation. </li>
